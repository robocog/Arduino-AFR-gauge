# Arduino-AFR-gauge
Arduino AFR gage and screen for wideband controller


I wanted to see what the output was from my Spartan2 wideband controller without the need for laptop or logging


This has been installed in my car for a few months and has worked flawlessly and seems to be accurate enough


I wanted initially to just drive an inexpensive narrowband analog gauge, but it eveoilved to also drive an SSD1306 screen to show the AFR and the controllers output voltage


This is my first project on here - so please be gentle whilst I work my way round the navigation
